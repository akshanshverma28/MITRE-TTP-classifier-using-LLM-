This scenario illustrates how the red team attacker, Alice, 
constructs a malicious macro within a MS-Office Word document (CVE-2015-1641). 
She then embeds an auto-phishing email malware into the document, disguising all 
malware as a harmless lucky draw USB driver. Subsequently, Alice sends this document 
to the unsuspecting victim Bob.
