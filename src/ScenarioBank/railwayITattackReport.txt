a hacker utilizes a phishing email and fake software update installer to circumvent the company's firewall, gaining access to the internal network from the internet. The fake update installer deploys a trojan to pilfer security information and inject and execute other OT attack malware within the company's protected ICS network.
The attack roadmap outlines four steps the hacker will take to execute the attack process, employing four distinct malware:
1. A phishing email generator camouflaged as a normal document.
2. A fake system software update installer designed to harvest user information and insert the backdoor trojan.
3. A backdoor trojan enabling remote control of the victim's VM.
4. A trojan connector facilitating connection to the trojan for remote control of the victim's VM.
